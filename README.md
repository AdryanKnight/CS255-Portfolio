# CS255-Portfolio
Portfolio work for CS 255
1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted to create a system that would help students prepare for their driving tests by offering online practice exams, scheduling driving lessons, and managing user accounts. The system needed to be accessible to students, instructors, and administrators, with features that supported scheduling, tracking progress, and maintaining accurate records.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in identifying the system’s core requirements and translating them into a structured business requirements document. I was able to clearly define the needs of different stakeholders and ensure that the system design reflected those needs. My diagrams also effectively communicated the flow of information and relationships between system components.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, I would improve the detail in the non-functional requirements section. While I addressed areas such as performance and security, I could have added more measurable benchmarks and examples, such as expected response times and specific security compliance standards, to make the document more robust and actionable.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the interview transcript and identifying the client’s priorities, such as ease of scheduling lessons and secure access for students. I translated those needs into design elements like role-based access and automated scheduling features. Considering user needs is essential because a system that doesn’t align with its users will fail to meet expectations, even if it is technically functional. User-centered design increases adoption, satisfaction, and overall effectiveness.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software involves first gathering clear requirements, then creating diagrams and models to visualize how the system will function. I focus on breaking down the system into smaller, manageable components and identifying the most efficient ways for those components to interact. In the future, I would use techniques such as iterative prototyping and user feedback sessions to validate designs earlier in the process, as well as leveraging agile practices to ensure flexibility and continuous improvement.
